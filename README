ChezWEB: A WEB system for Scheme
================================

Copyright (c) 2011 Aaron W. Hsu <arcfide@sacrideo.us>.

ChezWEB is a system for doing Knuthian style WEB programming in Scheme,
and more particularly, it is implemented in Chez Scheme. It has a
number of novel features, and is designed to provide a level of 
integration with Scheme that is not to be found in other Literate
Programming systems.

I have provided the quickstart information first, and you can find
the rest of the documentation further down.

Installing ChezWEB (QuickStart)
-------------------------------

The fastest way to install ChezWEB is to use the make file provided.
There are a few constants defined at the top of the file, which you
can change for your particular installation, but otherwise, it should
be as easy as:

  $ make install

which will install the bootfiles for ChezWEB into the appropriate
Chez Scheme folder, as well as create the program links in the 
appropriate bin directory. If you have custom needs, please make
sure to edit the variables to make sure that things are installed
correctly.

The makefile assumes that you already have a version of Chez Scheme
installed.

Installing ChezWEB (The Gory Details)
-------------------------------------

A more complete installation line might look like this:

  $ make install CSV=~/chezheap \
    PETITE=/usr/local/bin/petite \
    BIN=~/bin TEXMF=~/texmf/tex/chezweb MACHINE=i3le
    
The above line assumes that you want to install the heap files into your
home directory and that you already have ~/chezheap in your
SCHEMEHEAPDIRS environment variable. It also assumes that there is a
non-standard location where the Petite Chez Scheme binary is installed.
It assumes that you want to install cheztangle and chezweave into your
local bin directory instead of system wide, and it also assumes that you
want to install the TeX file into your local path as well. The MACHINE
parameter indicates that you are using an intel 386 version of Chez
Scheme.

The gory details of installing follow:

Basically, you want to do four things when you install ChezWEB:

1) Build the boot files.
2) Install the boot files into your heap path.
3) Install the TeX file into your TeX path.
4) Create the symlinks for cheztangle and chezweave.

1: Building the boot files

  If you already have Chez Scheme installed, just typing 'make' should
  build the boot files. You should not get errors or need to change
  anything to make this work, assuming that 'scheme' is in your path.
  
2: Installing the boot files

  If you are working from a binary distribution, you'll already have the
  boot files, and if you are working from source, you should make sure
  that you've finished building them.
  
  The install make target installs the boot files into 
  
    /usr/lib/csv8.1/$MACHINE
    
  And you should change this installation location if you have a
  different place where you install the heap files. This could be if you
  have a non-standard prefix that you used when installing ChezScheme,
  or it might also happen if you want to install ChezWEB for your user
  and not system-wide.
  
3: Installing the TeX macro file.

  TeX files generated by ChezWEAVE require that you have the chezwebmac
  file available in your TeX search path. Normalling this is something
  like /usr/share/texmf-local or /usr/local/share/texmf. If you are on a
  shared machine, often you will have a local texmf directory like
  .texmf-local or texmf that can be found or created in your home
  directory. Wherever you choose, you should install the chezwebmac.tex
  file into one of these directories. The Makefile installs the
  chezwebmac.tex file into the following path by default:
  
    /usr/share/texmf-local/tex/chezweb/chezwebmac.tex
    
  This is a good guess, but it will almost certainly need tweaking for
  your system.
  
  After installation you should run texhash to make sure that the
  chezwebmac.tex file is indexed.
  
4: Creating the symlinks

  Every Chez Scheme program is a symlink to either the petite or scheme
  executables. ChezTANGLE and ChezWEAVE are no different. Assuming that
  you have the scheme program installed into /usr/bin/scheme, you would
  need to do something like this:
  
    $ cd $BINDIR
    $ ln -s /usr/bin/scheme cheztangle
    $ ln -s /usr/bin/scheme chezweave
    
  This will finish the installation of ChezWEB, and you should now be
  able to use the ChezWEB programs.
  
The Makefile should take care of all of this for you if you can remember
to set the Makefile variables correctly.

Using ChezWEB without the compiler
----------------------------------

There are some scripts in the petite directory that will help users 
who want to run ChezWEB without having the compiled version.

System Requirements
-------------------

ChezWEB requires (Petite) Chez Scheme 8.x, as it is built on R6RS.

What makes ChezWEB unique? Why should I use it?
-----------------------------------------------

If you are reading this, I am going to assume that you already believe
in literate programming to some extent. Otherwise, if you don't find
any benefit to literate programming at all, then you probably will not
like ChezWEB.

However, if you like the idea of literate programming, I can hopefully
entice you into using ChezWEB for all your Literate Scheme needs.
I created ChezWEB because I was tired of literate programming that
wasn't Schemely, and that did not provide me with a proper level of
integration with Scheme.

Admittedly, the integration with Scheme in ChezWEB is lacking in the
area of pretty printing and a few other formatting niceities, but this
will hopefully be rectified by the first official 1.0 release. What
it does provide, is an integration with the concepts that underly
Scheme, including lexical scope, and the interaction environment.

Literate programming is really a sophisticated form of macrology.
Literate programming tools are like macro languages on top of the
normal programming language. These are usually fairly baroque when
you compare them to the hygienic sophistication that is available
in Scheme through syntax-rules and the full programmatic power of
syntax-case. However, they suffice quite well for other languages
that have no concept of these tools. Unfortunately, while it is okay
to have an additional macro preprocessor on top of my Scheme code,
the normal Literate programming tools have a number of severe drawbacks
that I don't like.

The largest problem concerns lexical scope. The normal programming
style one follows with a tool like CWEB or Noweb, is to have a bunch
of chunks or sections that just drop themselves into wherever they
are referenced. They are, in a sense, dynamically scoped. Scheme,
though, is a lexically scoped language, and it's rather ugly to
be dropping what is essentially a dynamically scoped macro language
on top; if I wanted that, I would be using DEFMACRO and Common Lisp!

ChezWEB bridges this gap. ChezWEB is actually built on top of the
Scheme macro system. It's an integrated part of Scheme, not just a
preprocessor on top of the Scheme macro system. This integration
lets it have access to the very important concept of hygiene and
lexical scope. When you define a section in ChezWEB, you define its
environment as well, including any imports, any exports that are 
visible outside of the chunk when it is referenced, as well as any
variables that are dynamically scoped (captures) whenever that
chunk is referenced. This means that you can control the scoping
and visibility of variables in your literate programs in the same
way that you already do with modules. In fact, the idea of a section
in WEB naturally fits within the idea of a module in Scheme.

Another complaint about literate programs is that you have to
compile them before you can use them in your Scheme environment.
Not so with ChezWEB. Because the code is actually Scheme code, you
use tangle as you would any other Scheme REPL. In fact, cheztangle
is just the Scheme REPL with an additional set of bindings for
the control codes in ChezWEB. This means that you don't ever
need to compile programs written in ChezWEB to use them. You just
load them up and you can interact and debug them directly.

Of course, you don't lose out on weaving because of these advantages,
instead, when you weave a ChezWEB file, you get back your nice
TeX file the way you would expect. I have tried to mirror the
look and feel of normal CWEB documents as much as possible.

Documentation
-------------

You can find a Guide to ChezWEB for User's in the guide directory.
Comments and suggestions for improvement are especially welcome here, 
since the guide, while exhaustive in feature coverage, does not 
really have much to say about any one thing.
