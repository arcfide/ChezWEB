ChezWEB is a system for doing Knuthian style WEB programming in Scheme, and
more particularly, it is implemented in Chez Scheme.  It has a number of
novel features, and is designed to provide a level of integration with
Scheme that is not to be found in other Literate Programming systems. In
particular, it implements hygienic named sections that perserve hygiene and
scoping in the presence of definitions and the like.

I have provided the quickstart information first, and you can find the rest
of the documentation further down.

Installing ChezWEB
──────────────────

The fastest way to install ChezWEB is to use the make file provided.  There
are a few constants defined at the top of the file, which you can change for
your particular installation, but otherwise, it should be as easy as:

  $ make build install

You should make sure you edit the constants to do what you want and to
install everything where you want them installed.  The makefile assumes that
you already have a version of Chez Scheme installed.

A more complete installation line might look like this:

	$ make build install \
	    PREFIX=<your_prefix> \
	    TEXDIR=... \
	    DOCDIR=... \
	    BINDIR=... \
	    LIBDIR=...

You can learn more about these values by running the installit script
without any arguments.  There are three main components to the ChezWEB
system.  

	1) ChezWEAVE and ChezTANGLE programs
	2) chezwebmac.tex macros
	3) Runtime library for independent use

To get this all working, we have to execute three build scripts to link it 
all up, followed by one install script.  

	bootstrap	Bootstraps the ChezWEB system
	tangleit	Tangles the actual ChezWEB programs
	weaveit		Weaves the ChezWEB documentation
	installit	Installs all the components

Using ChezWEB without the compiler
──────────────────────────────────

If you only have Petite Chez Scheme, you can still use ChezWEB.  There are
two things to change.  Firstly, build the system using the 'petite' target 
instead of the 'build' target.  Secondly, make sure that your CHEZWEBHOME
environment variable points to the LIBDIR that you specified. 

System Requirements
───────────────────

ChezWEB is tested on (Petite) Chez Scheme 8.4+, as it is built on R6RS and
relies on certain features introduced after version 8.0.  Earlier versions
may run, but there is no guarantee, and you should really be using the
latest version of Chez Scheme 8.x.

Documentation
─────────────

A copy of the CWEB manual is included with this distribution.  It provides
a basic overview of how a system like this should normally work.  It does
not focus on ChezWEB specifically, which is a known problem that I hope to
rectify soon.  If there are any volunteers....
