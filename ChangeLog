Changes from 1.0 to 1.1:

  The makefile package target now overwrites any tarballs that already
  exist.

  The Makefile now does a better job of cleaning the directory.

  The makefile is now included in binary packages.

  The README file is now included in binary packages and has been
  altered some.
  
  The chezwebmac.tex file is now included in binary packages.

  Greatly improved control over how and where exports are visible. There
  are now two control codes for inserting a chunk: @< and @<<. The @<
  inserts the chunk only into the current scope and does not allow them
  to escape, whereas the @<< wraps the exports at the call site where
  the enclosing @> is called.

  Library exports now have a greatly improved formatting.
  
  You now specify imports, exports, and captures through named options
  at the beginning of a chunk, and all of them are optional. That is,
  rather than doing something like this:
  
    (@> Blah () (a b) () (define a #t) (define b #f))
  
  You would now do something like this:
  
    (@> Blah (export a b) (define a #t) (define b #f))

  There have been many little formatting improvements in the TeX macros.
  The macros are now more robust, but not perfect.

  The exports and imports and, in fact, any long list controlled by
  ChezWEAVE will now dynamically switch from a ragged paragraph to a
  table format if there are too many elements. 

  The library handling is now more robust.

  The weaving of modules can now handle a more complete module syntax.
