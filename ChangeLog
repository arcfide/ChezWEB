Changs from 1.3.2 to 2.0:

  Change versioning scheme to only two digits.

  Improved README and documentation, though user guide is not quite there.

  Completely new underlying infrastructure and interface, which operates 
  mostly in the same way that CWEB does, with two offline programs 
  cheztangle and chezweave. 

  Output now looks like CWEB because it is based off of the cwebman.tex 
  file

  Improved support for Petite

  Greatly improved build system

  A copy of the CWEB manual is now included in place of the old and
  incomplete guide; this will be expanded and changed in future releases 
  to reflect unique ChezWEB-isms.

  We have improved the underlying pretty printer in preparation for more 
  sophisticated pretty printing.

  Improved reliability of the output

  Improved meta data tracking in captures and exports

  Improved formatting of captures and exports

  The programs chezweave and cheztangle now produce more helpful output 
  to track down bugs and problems.

  Empty section bodies are allowed now.

  Fully new and mostly compatible CWEB syntax that is not nested
  s-expressions

  Support for including files

  Indexing support with a section and keyword index.

  Improved automatic table of contents

  Section heading levels with nesting.

  Implicit and explicit indexing support

  Support for concatenation of sections

  Section names do not need to have their captures threaded explicitely 
  anymore

  Support for automatic cross-referencing of section names and numbers

  ChezWEB is now written in ChezWEB and can weave/tangle itself

  This is a complete rewrite of the system

Changes from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2:

  Fix the @> handling of ellipses in the case where we return a value 
  instead of export definitions.

Changes from 1.3 to 1.3.1:

  Make @e a definition rather than a value form.

  Make it possible to access the parameters of ChezWEAVE in @e.

Changes from 1.2.3 to 1.3:

  Make the system compatible with Chez Scheme 8.2, 8.1, and 8.0.

  Miscellaneous Typo fixes.

  Add an evaluator form to evaluate code during weaving for their 
  side-effects. Useful for setting pretty printer settings.

  Add scripts to help those who might want to use the source version 
  of ChezWEB with Petite, without the compiler.

  Adjust the behavior of named chunks to enable macros with ellipses 
  to be defined without needing to be wrapped in a (... ---) form 
  so long as no ellipses appear in the capture clause.

  The guide has been updated to reflect the changes above with some 
  examples and more exposition.

Changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3:

  Fix a bug where ‘quote’ was not handled in the right way in 
  ChezWEAVE.

Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2:

  Upgrade the system to use the latest Chez Scheme version 8.1.

Changes from 1.2 to 1.2.1:
 
  Fix a bug in the order of exact? and integer? checks in ChezWEAVE.
 
Changes from 1.1 to 1.2:

  Enable environment variables CHEZWEBMAXELEMS and CHEZWEBLISTCOLUMNS
  to control the limits of the simple elemtsn and number of columns
  that are generate for output in ChezWEB.  This tells the weave
  program when it should go from simple listings to columns of
  listings for exports and such.

  Various reliability improvements have been introduced, including
  fixes to the TeX file and the way that we output the TeX, which
  enables a greater range of characters in the source code.

  @<< and @chunk-ref/thread have been fixed so that threading will
  occur even in cases where there is a bunch of nesting.

  A manual has been created for ChezWEB, and we now ship with the TeX
  file available for users.

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1:

  You can now use long names for the control codes rather than just the
  short ones:
  
    @     @section
    @*    @section/header
    @<    @chunk-ref
    @<<   @chunk-ref/thread
    @>    @define-chunk
    @c    @code
    @l    @library

  The makefile package target now overwrites any tarballs that already
  exist.

  The Makefile now does a better job of cleaning the directory.

  The makefile is now included in binary packages.

  The README file is now included in binary packages and has been
  altered some.
  
  The chezwebmac.tex file is now included in binary packages.

  Greatly improved control over how and where exports are visible. There
  are now two control codes for inserting a chunk: @< and @<<. The @<
  inserts the chunk only into the current scope and does not allow them
  to escape, whereas the @<< wraps the exports at the call site where
  the enclosing @> is called.

  Library exports now have a greatly improved formatting.
  
  You now specify imports, exports, and captures through named options
  at the beginning of a chunk, and all of them are optional. That is,
  rather than doing something like this:
  
    (@> Blah () (a b) () (define a #t) (define b #f))
  
  You would now do something like this:
  
    (@> Blah (export a b) (define a #t) (define b #f))

  There have been many little formatting improvements in the TeX macros.
  The macros are now more robust, but not perfect.

  The exports and imports and, in fact, any long list controlled by
  ChezWEAVE will now dynamically switch from a ragged paragraph to a
  table format if there are too many elements. 

  The library handling is now more robust.

  The weaving of modules can now handle a more complete module syntax.
