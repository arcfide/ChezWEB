Changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.1:

  Fix a bug where ‘quote’ was not handled in the right way in 
  ChezWEAVE.

Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2:

  Upgrade the system to use the latest Chez Scheme version 8.1.

Changes from 1.2 to 1.2.1:
 
  Fix a bug in the order of exact? and integer? checks in ChezWEAVE.
 
Changes from 1.1 to 1.2:

  Enable environment variables CHEZWEBMAXELEMS and CHEZWEBLISTCOLUMNS
  to control the limits of the simple elemtsn and number of columns
  that are generate for output in ChezWEB.  This tells the weave
  program when it should go from simple listings to columns of
  listings for exports and such.

  Various reliability improvements have been introduced, including
  fixes to the TeX file and the way that we output the TeX, which
  enables a greater range of characters in the source code.

  @<< and @chunk-ref/thread have been fixed so that threading will
  occur even in cases where there is a bunch of nesting.

  A manual has been created for ChezWEB, and we now ship with the TeX
  file available for users.

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1:

  You can now use long names for the control codes rather than just the
  short ones:
  
    @     @section
    @*    @section/header
    @<    @chunk-ref
    @<<   @chunk-ref/thread
    @>    @define-chunk
    @c    @code
    @l    @library

  The makefile package target now overwrites any tarballs that already
  exist.

  The Makefile now does a better job of cleaning the directory.

  The makefile is now included in binary packages.

  The README file is now included in binary packages and has been
  altered some.
  
  The chezwebmac.tex file is now included in binary packages.

  Greatly improved control over how and where exports are visible. There
  are now two control codes for inserting a chunk: @< and @<<. The @<
  inserts the chunk only into the current scope and does not allow them
  to escape, whereas the @<< wraps the exports at the call site where
  the enclosing @> is called.

  Library exports now have a greatly improved formatting.
  
  You now specify imports, exports, and captures through named options
  at the beginning of a chunk, and all of them are optional. That is,
  rather than doing something like this:
  
    (@> Blah () (a b) () (define a #t) (define b #f))
  
  You would now do something like this:
  
    (@> Blah (export a b) (define a #t) (define b #f))

  There have been many little formatting improvements in the TeX macros.
  The macros are now more robust, but not perfect.

  The exports and imports and, in fact, any long list controlled by
  ChezWEAVE will now dynamically switch from a ragged paragraph to a
  table format if there are too many elements. 

  The library handling is now more robust.

  The weaving of modules can now handle a more complete module syntax.
